In [Seminars](https://github.com/ombystoma-young/rosalind-club/tree/main/Seminars) you can find problems that was solved on previous club meetings.  

For now you can find us at Skoltech in room B4-3007 on Tuesdays 10 AM till 11:30 AM. Also sometimes we arrange zoom meetings to recap. If you are interested - write to me and I can invite you to your next meeting. 

Basically, we solve problems using pure python code, but in some cases we use biopython and see how it is implemented inside it. There are plans to do small workshops on topics like Git, R and Bash for bioinformatics.
